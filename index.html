  <p class="profile-me">I was born in Toronto in October, 16th 1973. I graduated from Humber College in the spring of 1995 and for 3 years I was in sales at a local Electronics Retail chain. I opened up a computer shop in 1998 ran that until 2012. I was a DJ in the late 80's & early 90's so around 2008 I started DJing again turned that into my full-time career in 2012.</p>
